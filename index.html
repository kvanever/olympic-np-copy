        We love this park so much because it has so many trees.  There is also more outside things in this park.

          <h2>Hiking</h2>
          <p>
            Olympic National Park has lots of trees.  You can walk around in them.  It's like walking but outside.  We call it hiking.

          <h2>Places to Stay</h2>
          <p>
            Olympic Park has this building.  It's not a hotel, because, again, we're outside.  It's a lodge.
